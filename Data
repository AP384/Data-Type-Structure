DATA TYPE & STRUCTURE

Data types deal with the classification and representation of individual data items, while data structures focus on how to organize and store multiple data items in a way that facilitates efficient operations and algorithms.

Data types are the building blocks for constructing data structures, as the choice of data types used in a data structure influences its behavior and performance.

DATA TYPE
Data type is a classification of data based on the type of value it holds. It defines the constraints on the data and the set of operations that can be applied to them.

STRING TYPE
String type represents textual data, each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on.JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it. String methods create new strings based on the content of the current string.

BOOLEAN TYPE
Boolean represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false. Boolean values are mostly used for conditional operations, including ternary operators, if...else, while, etc.

NUMBER TYPE
Number values represent floating-point numbers like 1.61803, 3.14159 or 1.

BIGINT TYPE
BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) for Numbers.

NULL TYPE
Null indicates the absence of an object

UNDEFINED TYPE
Undefined indicates the absence of a value. JS language usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value (return statement, accessing a nonexistent object property, variable declaration without initialization and others).
